## Introduction

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See the [table of contents](#toc) for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them!📝

Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers to make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved. 💚

## Request Support or Report an Error

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/navarasu/serverless-ruby-layer/issues
* Fill the template and you are good to go👍

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* Someone will try to have a response soon.
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/navarasu/serverless-ruby-layer/issues
* Follow the template for Enhancements and you are good to go👍

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.
* If the feature request is accepted, it will be marked for implementation with `feature-accepted`, which can then be done by either by a core team member or by anyone in the community who wants to contribute code.

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

## Project Setup

To Be Updated soon !!!
